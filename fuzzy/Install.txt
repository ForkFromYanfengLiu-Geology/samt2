The SAMTFUZZY part need now nlopt for parameteroptimization.
Please install nlopt from:

http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt

Take care that you have installed the Python language bindings. 
(./configure --enable-shared  --with-gnu-ld) worked in my environment.
After "sudo make install" and "sudo ldconfig" the nlopt can be used inside
of Python (import nlopt).

The Pyfuzzy.py should be compiled using "make" Please adapt the  
"sys.path.append(...)" according your needs. To use Pyfuzzy you must compile
SAMT2 too. Please compile SAMT2 typing "make" in the directory ../samt2

To compile everything you have to install Cython, "Python dev", numpy,
matplotlib etc. firstly. But this should be clear for a Python programmer.

Happy hacking,

Ralf3.
